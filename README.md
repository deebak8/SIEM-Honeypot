Cyber Home Lab: Microsoft Sentinel Honeypot System The Cyber Home Lab is a cybersecurity environment built around Microsoft Sentinel that deploys a honeypot system to detect, analyze, and visualize potential attackers. This setup uses intentionally vulnerable systems to attract malicious actors, capturing their activity while revealing their IP addresses. The collected attack data is then ingested into Microsoft Sentinel (Microsoft's cloud-native SIEM solution) for processing and analysis. Key features include:

Real-time detection of attack attempts against the honeypot Automated collection of attacker data, including IP addresses Geographic visualization of attack origins on interactive Azure maps Integration with Microsoft Sentinel's security analytics

The system provides security researchers and home lab enthusiasts with hands-on experience in threat detection while generating valuable insights into current attack methodologies and threat actor behaviors in a controlled environment.RetryDexplain it in detailEditCyber Home Lab with Microsoft Sentinel Honeypot: Detailed Explanation Core Components Honeypot Infrastructure The Cyber Home Lab centers around one or more honeypot systemsâ€”deliberately vulnerable machines designed to attract attackers. These systems typically:

Appear as legitimate but poorly secured servers/devices Expose common services (SSH, RDP, web applications, SMB) Capture detailed logs of all interaction attempts Run in isolated segments of your network to prevent lateral movement

Microsoft Sentinel Integration Microsoft Sentinel serves as the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) backbone, providing:

Log ingestion pipeline for honeypot telemetry Analytic rules to identify attack patterns Incident creation and management Extended detection and response (XDR) capabilities

Log Collection & Processing

Custom log collectors deploy on or alongside honeypot systems Azure Log Analytics workspace serves as the central repository Log parsers extract key data points (IP addresses, attack types, timestamps, etc.) Data connectors maintain the flow from honeypots to Sentinel

Key Functional Areas Attack Detection & Analysis

Honeypots log all connection attempts, commands executed, and exploitation methods Custom Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries automatically identify attack signatures Machine learning detects anomalous behaviors and new attack patterns Incidents are created based on attack severity and characteristics

IP Geolocation & Visualization

IP addresses from attack attempts are extracted and enriched with geolocation data Azure Maps integration creates interactive visualizations showing:

Global attack origin distribution Heat maps of attack intensity by region

Custom dashboards present attack telemetry with drill-down capabilities

Threat Intelligence Generation

Attack vectors and techniques are cataloged and classified Common attacker tools and payloads are captured for analysis IP reputation data is compiled and can be exported

Implementation Process Setup Process

Deploy Azure resources (VMs, networking, storage) Configure honeypot systems with deliberate vulnerabilities Install monitoring agents on honeypot systems Configure Log Analytics workspace and data connectors Deploy Microsoft Sentinel and create custom workbooks Develop IP geolocation processing logic Build map visualizations in Sentinel workbooks

Security Considerations

Network isolation prevents compromised honeypots from becoming attack vectors Rate limiting prevents Azure costs from spiking during intensive attacks Data sanitization removes potentially harmful content before analysis Legal disclaimers may be required depending on jurisdiction

Advanced Features Automated Response

Playbooks can automatically block malicious IPs at the firewall/NSG level Integration with Azure Security Center for unified security posture management Threat intelligence sharing with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Enhanced Attribution

Correlation with known threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) Fingerprinting of tools and methodologies Behavioral profiling of attack patterns

Expanded Analytics

Custom attack funnel visualizations showing progression stages Service-specific attack dashboards (SSH vs. web attacks) Temporal analysis of attack waves and campaigns

This comprehensive setup allows security practitioners to safely observe actual attack techniques in a controlled environment while developing practical skills with Microsoft's cloud security tooling and generating actionable threat intelligence.
